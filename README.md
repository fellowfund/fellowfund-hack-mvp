# FellowFund

**FellowFund** is an on-chain platform for fellowship funding that uses prediction markets to support individuals. By allowing bettors to stake on future outcomes, it reduces governance overhead and promotes informed, outcome-driven funding for ecosystem growth. This "skin in the game" approach aligns incentives and improves decision-making.
